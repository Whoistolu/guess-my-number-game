## The goal of this project is to guess a secret number wchich is between (1-20).
## After each guess that the player fails, the score decreases by one (1)

I built this game to solidify my knowledge of:
1. DOM and DOM Manipulation.
2. Selecting and Manipulating Elements.
3. Handling Click Events
4. Implementing Logics
5. Refactoring code using the DRY principle.
6. Manipulating CSS styles.
